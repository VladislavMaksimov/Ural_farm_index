# Ural_farm_index
The main page of the "Ural" collective farm's webiste re-created by me with the adaptive design. Only html & css were changed to make the layout adaptive. Besides html & css I used Sass preprocessor and Bootstrap framework. The layout was created as a final project in the course on adaptive layout at the IT University (Perm, 2020).

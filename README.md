# ural-farm-index
The main page of the "Ural" collective farm's webiste re-created by me with the adaptive design. Only html & css were changed to make the layout adaptive. Besides html & css I used Sass preprocessor, Bootstrap framework and pure JS a bit. The layout was created as a final project in the course on adaptive layout at the IT University (Perm, 2020).
